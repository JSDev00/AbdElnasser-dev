Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.dev/client) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.


npm run ios
Like ### `npm start` /### `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.
